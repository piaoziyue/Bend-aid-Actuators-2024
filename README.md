## Key functions

- Pitch Modulation via TorqueTuner: Allows users to synthesize vibrato by controlling pitch through the rotation of the TorqueTuner knob, providing customizable force feedback modes.
- MIDI Sequencer Integration:
    - Add, highlight, move, and resize notes intuitively.
    - Supports editing a wide range of notes and importing, clearing, or manually entering note data.
- TorqueTuner Visualizer:
    - Real-time monitoring of rotation angle and torque value.
    - Displays angle contour aligned with MIDI notes and allows saving pitch contour data as a CSV file.
- Data Communication:
    - Real-time data exchange between TorqueTuner and Bend-aid via USB.
    - Supports pitch modulation and mode adjustments with feedback displayed on both the Bend-aid interface and TorqueTuner's LCD.

## Installation Guide

To set up the software environment, follow these steps:

1. **Clone the repository from GitHub**:

    git clone https://github.com/piaoziyue/Bend-aid-Actuators-2024.git
    ```

2. **Upload Firmware to TorqueTuner**:  
   Upload the `TorqueTuner_ESP32` code to your TorqueTuner device using the appropriate tool.

3. **Open the Web Interface**:  
   Open `index.html` in your browser using Live Server or a similar local web hosting tool.

4. **Connect TorqueTuner to Bend-aid**:  
   Connect the TorqueTuner device to the Bend-aid system for real-time interaction.
